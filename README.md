# Flower Classification using Image Processing
## Dataset
The dataset contains 4 different classes of flowers: Sunflower, Bonsai, Strawberry and Lotus.

## Objective
To extract features- Spatial and Frequency Domain, then proceed with Classification.

## Procedure
1. Noise removal
2. Normalization
3. Edge detection
4. Feature Extraction- From Spatial and Frequency Domain, around 64 features are extracted. 
5. Data Modelling- KNN, Random Forest and SVC with Cross Validation.
